            <h2>Our History</h2>
            <p>Coffee grown worldwide can trace its heritage back centuries to the ancient coffee forests on the Ethiopian plateau. There, legend says the goat herder Kaldi first discovered the potential of these beloved beans. </p>
            <p>The story goes that that Kaldi discovered coffee after he noticed that after eating the berries from a certain tree, his goats became so energetic that they did not want to sleep at night. 
            </p>
            <p>As word moved east and coffee reached the Arabian peninsula, it began a journey which would bring these beans across the globe.

                <p>I really like the atmosphere, good coffee, and nice interior. This is a good place to study or chill with friends. The drinks and foods were all tasty and worthwhile. If you’re up for a fresh place with beautiful architecture.</p>

                <p>This is a great coffee shop/bar combo that you can spend a lot of time hanging out in without knowing where the time went. I do like the coffee shop itself though! Nice place to study and just catch up on reading.</p>
